## About Me

Hi! My name is Alex Stedman and welcome to my personal projects page.  The following is a little bit about me.

I graduated in 2007 from the University of Nottingham after taking an undergraduate Masters in Science (MSci) in Physics with Theoretical Astrophysics.  I went on to do a graduate Masters of Science (MSc) in Exploration Geophysics from the University of Leeds in 2008.  I then entered the oil & gas exploration industry, initially working on data cleaning and optimisation before moving in to the offshore data acquisition sector.  There I learned to love working with vast data sets; acquiring, assessing, cleaning and processing the data into usable formats for drilling.

In 2016 I moved in to Geophysical Software Sales and then on to Financial Advice, but neither gave me the kind of stimulation from my data processing days.  So in 2020 I took a Data Science Bootcamp with General Assembly exploring Regression, Classification, Neural Networks and Statistics (to name just a few).  I had 4 deadlined projects and capstone project, some of which you will find here.
